# MS KB3009008: Vulnerability in SSL 3.0 Could Allow Information Disclosure (POODLE)

The remote host is missing one of the workarounds referenced in the Microsoft Security Advisory 3009008.

If the client registry key workaround has not been applied, any client software installed on the remote host (including IE) is affected by an information disclosure vulnerability when using SSL 3.0.

If the server registry key workaround has not been applied, any server software installed on the remote host (including IIS) is affected by an information disclosure vulnerability when using SSL 3.0.

SSL 3.0 uses nondeterministic CBC padding, which allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to decrypt portions of encrypted traffic using a 'padding oracle' attack. This is also known as the 'POODLE' issue.
