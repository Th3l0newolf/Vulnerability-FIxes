# SSH Server CBC Mode Ciphers Enabled

The SSH server is configured to support Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) encryption. This may allow an attacker to recover the plaintext message from the ciphertext.

Note that this plugin only checks for the options of the SSH server and does not check for vulnerable software versions.

## Related Information

- Severity: Low
- Fix: Manual/Automated
- Solution:consult product documentation to disable CBC mode cipher encryption, and enable CTR or GCM cipher mode encryption.


## Fix

For this vulnerability scan result, modify the configuration of SSHD to fix the issue:

Note:- Same approch is used for fixing this vulnerability on network and security devices as well , execution commnads may differ as per devices.(

1.Open sshd_config in /etc/ssh directory.

2.Remove the CBC ciphers under Ciphers & keep “Ciphers aes256-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes128-ctr” only.

3.Save and quit. 

4.Restart sshd service
